# Bibliometric Analysis Project

## Project Description

This project performs a bibliometric analysis using bibliographic data extracted from **Web of Science** and **Scopus**. The objective is to uncover research trends, collaboration patterns, and thematic areas by integrating, cleaning, and analysing metadata, such as authorship, affiliations, and keywords. The analysis also includes constructing collaboration networks for countries, institutions, and authors, as well as identifying prominent research topics through keyword co-occurrence analysis.

## Key Analyses

1. Consolidation and cleaning of bibliographic data from multiple `.bib` files.
2. Summary of bibliometric indicators (e.g., publication trends, authorship patterns).
3. Construction and visualisation of collaboration networks for countries, universities, and authors.
4. Exploration of keyword co-occurrence networks to identify research themes.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following R packages:

- `rio`: Import/export of data.
- `here`: File path management.
- `tidyverse`: Data manipulation and visualisation.
- `ggplot2`: Data visualisation.
- `data.table`: Efficient data manipulation.
- `dplyr`: Data wrangling.
- `bibliometrix`: Bibliometric analysis.
- `readxl`: Reading Excel files.
- `tidyr`: Data tidying.
- `openxlsx`: Exporting results to Excel.

Ensure all required packages are installed using the `pacman` package loader:
```r
pacman::p_load(
  rio, here, tidyverse, ggplot2, data.table, dplyr, bibliometrix, 
  readxl, tidyr, openxlsx
)
