### Introduction

This project aims to perform a bibliometric analysis to uncover research trends, collaboration patterns, and thematic areas within bibliographic data extracted from **Web of Science** and **Scopus** databases. The primary objective is to integrate, clean, and analyse metadata such as authorship, affiliations, and keywords, while also constructing collaboration networks for countries, institutions, and authors. Additionally, keyword co-occurrence networks are explored to identify prominent research topics.

### Key analyses
1. Consolidation and cleaning of bibliographic data from multiple `.bib` files.  
2. Summarisation of key bibliometric indicators, such as publication trends and authorship patterns.  
3. Construction and visualisation of collaboration networks for countries, universities, and authors.  
4. Identification of thematic areas through keyword co-occurrence analysis.  

### Packages usage
The project utilises R packages, including `tidyverse` and `data.table` for data manipulation, `bibliometrix` for bibliometric analysis, `ggplot2` for visualisation, and `openxlsx` for exporting results.
